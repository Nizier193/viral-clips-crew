On the other hand, I think it's still under, I know, I know, I know, exactly, exactly. But, but, um, you know, I think it's still underhyped, or perhaps underappreciated still, even now, what's going to happen when we get to AGI and post-AGI.\"",

They've got very smart people in the civil service stuff that are, um, understand the technology now to to a good degree. And it's been great to see the AI safety institutes being set up in the UK and US and I think many other countries are going to follow. So I think these are all good precedents and protocols.\"",

Well, there are some well-known benchmarks, academic ones, but they're kind of getting saturated now, and they don't differentiate between the nuances between the different top models. I would say there's sort of three models that are kind of at the top of the frontier. So it's, um, Gemini from us, OpenAI GPT of course, and then Anthropic with their Claude models. And then obviously there's a bunch of other good models too that, you know, people like Meta and Mistral and others built, and they're differently good at different things.\"",

As you know, we've, I mean, we've given away and published almost everything we've done, uh, you know, collectively including like things like transformers, right, and AlphaGo. I published all these things in Nature and Science, AlphaFold was open source as we covered last time. And these are all good choices. And you're absolutely right, that's the reason that all works is because that's the way technology and science advances as quickly as possible by sharing information. So almost always, that's a universal good to do it like that, and that's how science works.\"",
